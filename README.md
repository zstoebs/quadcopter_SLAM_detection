# SLAM and Object Detection

Demonstrating SLAM and object detection with a Parrot ANAFI. The code depends on [pyparrot](https://github.com/amymcgovern/pyparrot). Pyparrot is an Python API for Parrot quadcopters and I'm extremely thankful for the owner's work, after running into every issue that one could possible have with the Parrot GroundSDK. 

## Usage
1. Consulting the [pyparrot documentation](https://pyparrot.readthedocs.io/) and follow the install instructions. 
2. Make sure that the Parrot is switched on and that the ground machine (e.g. laptop) is connected to the Parrot's wifi. 

## To-Do
- Add a requirements.txt
- Actually program SLAM and object detection

More to come soon!
